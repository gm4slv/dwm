This is my branch of DWM

I followed the instructions at

https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/patches_in_git/

and I push changes in this branch to Github.

I hope to be able to track/apply/update changes in the DWM
source from suckless.org (in the master branch) to my branch
if/when it gets significant updates.
